    "## Introduction to Using LangChain with MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive tutorial designed to introduce you to [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) and its integration with MLflow. This tutorial is structured as a notebook to provide a hands-on, practical learning experience with the simplest and most core features of LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding LangChain**: Get to know the basics of LangChain and how it is used in developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "- **Chains in LangChain**: Explore the concept of `chains` in LangChain, which are sequences of actions or operations orchestrated to perform complex tasks.\n",
    "- **Integration with MLflow**: Learn how LangChain integrates with MLflow, a platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including logging, tracking, and deploying models.\n",
    "- **Practical Application**: Apply your knowledge to build a LangChain chain that acts like a sous chef, focusing on the preparation steps of a recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background on LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a Python-based framework that simplifies the development of applications using language models. It is designed to enhance context-awareness and reasoning in applications, allowing for more sophisticated and interactive functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Chain?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chain Definition**: In LangChain, a `chain` refers to a series of interconnected components or steps designed to accomplish a specific task. \n",
    "- **Chain Example**: In our tutorial, we'll create a chain that simulates a sous chef's role in preparing ingredients and tools for a recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up LangChain and MLflow**: Initialize and configure both LangChain and MLflow.\n",
    "2. **Create a Sous Chef Chain**: Develop a LangChain chain that lists ingredients, describes preparation techniques, organizes ingredient staging, and details cooking implements preparation for a given recipe.\n",
    "3. **Log and Load the Model**: Utilize MLflow to log the chain model and then load it for prediction.\n",
    "4. **Run a Prediction**: Execute the chain to see how it would prepare a restaurant dish for a specific number of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid foundation in using LangChain with MLflow and an understanding of how to construct and manage chains for practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in and explore the world of LangChain and MLflow!\n"

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get started with this tutorial, we're going to need a few things first. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. An OpenAI API Account. You can [sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/login?launch) to get access in order to start programatically accessing one of the leading highly sophisticated LLM services on the planet.\n",
    "2. An OpenAI API Key. You can access this once you've created an account by navigating [to the API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).\n",
    "3. The OpenAI SDK. It's [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) here. For this tutorial, we're going to be using version 0.28.1 (the last release prior to the 1.0 release).\n",
    "4. The LangChain package. You can [find it here on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/). \n",
    "\n",
    "To install the dependent packages simply run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install 'openai<1' tiktoken langchain mlflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: If you'd like to use Azure OpenAI with LangChain, you need to install `openai>=1.10.0` and `langchain-openai>=0.0.6`."

    "### API Key Security Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "API keys, especially for SaaS Large Language Models (LLMs), are as sensitive as financial information due to their connection to billing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in learning more about an alternative MLflow solution that securely manages your access keys, [read about the deployments server here](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/deployments/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Essential Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidentiality**: Always keep API keys private.\n",
    "- **Secure Storage**: Prefer environment variables or secure services.\n",
    "- **Frequent Rotation**: Regularly update keys to avoid unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuring API Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "For secure usage, set API keys as environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**macOS/Linux**:\n",
    "Refer to [Apple's guide on using environment variables in Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/apd382cc5fa-4f58-4449-b20a-41c53c006f8f/mac) for detailed instructions.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section of the tutorial, we have configured the OpenAI model with specific parameters suitable for generating language completions. We're using a Completions model, not ChatCompletions, which means each request is independent, and the entire prompt needs to be included every time to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Completions Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Completions Model**: This model does not maintain contextual information across requests. It's ideal for tasks where each request is standalone and doesn't depend on past interactions. Offers flexibility for a variety of non-conversational applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Contextual Memory**: The lack of memory of previous interactions means the model is best suited for one-off requests or scenarios where continuity of the conversation is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparisons with the ChatCompletions Model Type**: Tailored for conversational AI, maintaining context across multiple exchanges for a continuous conversation. Suitable for chatbots or applications where dialogue history is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use the Completions model for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling individual, independent requests, aligning with our tutorial's focus on preparation steps before cooking.\n"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final step of our tutorial, we execute another prediction using our LangChain model. This time, we explore the preparation for \"Okonomiyaki,\" a Japanese dish, for 12 customers. This demonstrates the model's adaptability and versatility across various cuisines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Prediction with the Loaded Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model processes the input for \"Okonomiyaki\" and outputs detailed preparation steps. This includes listing the ingredients, explaining the preparation techniques, guiding ingredient staging, and detailing the required cooking implements, showcasing the model's capability to handle diverse recipes with precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Versatility**: The tutorial highlighted the LangChain framework for assembling component parts of a basic LLM application, chaining a specific instructional prompt to a Completions-style LLM.\n",
    "- **MLflow's Role in Model Management**: The integration of LangChain with MLflow demonstrated effective model lifecycle management, from creation and logging to prediction execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial offered an insightful journey through creating, managing, and utilizing a LangChain model with MLflow for culinary preparation. It showcased the practical applications and adaptability of LangChain in complex scenarios. We hope this experience has provided valuable knowledge and encourages you to further explore and innovate using LangChain and MLflow in your projects. Happy coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue learning about the capabilities of MLflow and LangChain in more complex examples, we encourage you to continue your learning with [the additional LangChain tutorials](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/langchain/index.html#advanced-tutorials)."
