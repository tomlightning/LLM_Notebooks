Any MLflow Python model is expected to be loadable as a python_function model.\n\nIn addition, the mlflow.pyfunc module defines a generic filesystem format for Python models and provides utilities for saving to and loading from this format. The format is self contained in the sense that it includes all necessary information for anyone to load it and use it. Dependencies are either stored directly with the model or referenced via a Conda environment.\n\nThe mlflow.pyfunc module also defines utilities for creating custom pyfunc models using frameworks and inference logic that may not be natively included in MLflow\n\n\ncustom implementation for semantic search using MLflow and Sentence Transformers\n\n# pyfunc\n\nhttps://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#pyfunc-create-custom\n\nhttps://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel\n\n# CloudPickle\nhttps://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle\n\ncloudpickle can serialize Python functions, lambda functions, and locally defined classes and functions inside other functions. This makes cloudpickle especially useful for parallel and distributed computing where code objects need to be sent over network to execute on remote workers\n\n\n# Function-based Model vs Class-based Model\nWhen creating custom PyFunc models, you can choose between two different interfaces: a function-based model and a class-based model. In short, a function-based model is simply a python function that does not take additional params. The class-based model, on the other hand, is subclass of PythonModel that supports several required and optional methods. If your use case is simple and fits within a single predict function, a funcion-based approach is recommended. If you need more power, such as custom serialization, custom data processing, or to override additional methods, you should use the class-based implementation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n%pip install mlflow==2.11.2 -q\n%pip install transformers==4.39.3  pyngrok datasets sentence_transformers -q","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-18T19:52:30.520339Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-18T19:52:30.520794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-18T19:53:02.289893Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-18T19:52:30.520760Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-18T19:53:02.288530Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\nNote: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\nuser_secrets = UserSecretsClient()\nNGROK = user_secrets.get_secret(\"NGROK\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-18T20:14:18.554317Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-18T20:14:18.554895Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-18T20:14:18.883970Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-18T20:14:18.554849Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-18T20:14:18.882619Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nfrom pyngrok import ngrok\n\nget_ipython().system_raw(\"mlflow ui --port 5000 &\")\n\n\n# Terminate open tunnels if exist\nngrok.kill()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-18T20:14:21.070938Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-18T20:14:21.071403Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-18T20:14:21.117165Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-18T20:14:21.071370Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-18T20:14:21.115704Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_config.py:321: UserWarning: Valid config keys have changed in V2:\n* 'schema_extra' has been renamed to 'json_schema_extra'\n  warnings.warn(message, UserWarning)\n[2024-05-18 20:14:25 +0000] [139] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0\n[2024-05-18 20:14:25 +0000] [139] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:5000 (139)\n[2024-05-18 20:14:25 +0000] [139] [INFO] Using worker: sync\n[2024-05-18 20:14:25 +0000] [140] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 140\n[2024-05-18 20:14:25 +0000] [141] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 141\n[2024-05-18 20:14:25 +0000] [142] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 142\n[2024-05-18 20:14:25 +0000] [143] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 143\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ngrok.set_auth_token(NGROK)\n\n# Open an HTTPs tunnel on port 5000 for http://localhost:5000\nngrok_tunnel = ngrok.connect(addr=\"5000\", proto=\"http\", bind_tls=True)\nprint(\"MLflow Tracking UI:\", ngrok_tunnel.public_url)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-18T20:14:32.952504Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-18T20:14:32.952957Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-18T20:14:34.727582Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-18T20:14:32.952924Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-18T20:14:34.726257Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"MLflow Tracking UI: https://6e48-34-168-103-30.ngrok-free.app                                       \n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\n\n# Disable a few less-than-useful UserWarnings from setuptools and pydantic\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=UserWarning)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-18T20:17:35.436775Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-18T20:17:35.437179Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-18T20:17:35.443177Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-18T20:17:35.437149Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-18T20:17:35.441860Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\n\nimport mlflow\nfrom mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-18T20:17:32.354800Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-18T20:17:32.355518Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-18T20:17:32.362197Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-18T20:17:32.355480Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-18T20:17:32.360742Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# CloudPickle\nhttps://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle\n\ncloudpickle can serialize Python functions, lambda functions, and locally defined classes and functions inside other functions.
