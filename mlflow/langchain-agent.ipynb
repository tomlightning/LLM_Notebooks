    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In our LangChain Agents tutorial, we leverage an important dependency known as `SerpAPI`. This tool is pivotal in providing our LangChain agent with API access to various search engines, crucial for retrieving real-time data from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing SerpAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "To use SerpAPI, you'll need to install it via pip. It's a straightforward process, and the package is named `google-search-results`. Once installed, you can create an account at [SerpAPI's Official Website](https://serpapi.com/) and retrieve an API Key. In order to use this integration with LangChain, you can simply load the toolset via `load_tools([\"serpapi\"])` to allow the LangChain agent access to the Google Search APIs.\n",
