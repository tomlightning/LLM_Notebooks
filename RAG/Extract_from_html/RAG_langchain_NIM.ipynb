    "# RAG\n",
    "- RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.\n",
    "- LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on.\n",
    "- If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs.\n",
    "- The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG).\n",
