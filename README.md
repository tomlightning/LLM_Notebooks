# LLM_Notebooks

This Repository contains all material supporting the Videos in my YouTube channel The Machine Learning Engineer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqAi1lTsd2wj7p05-Oos4ug

Look to the Playlist bellow to understand which kind of Material we have on the channel and here.

The best way to find some information it is look for in the channel for a topic and there if something matches what you are looking for watch the video and each of them contains a link to this repository. Videos are in English and Spanish, and I referred to the folders of this repository on the description of each video.
Videos are classified in Playlists per topics, and each topic is very general, and a video can fall in a couple of topics. Playlists are also organized in languages Spanish and English

I upload Videos almost every day and the best way to solve a doubt or an issue it is to comment in the video. I try to answer as soon as I can. This I am doing a part of my job.

I will appreciate if you subscribe to the channel

Also if you are dont find something, let me know in a comment in Youtube and I will point you out to the video and Notebook or Code if I have it or something that may help you.
