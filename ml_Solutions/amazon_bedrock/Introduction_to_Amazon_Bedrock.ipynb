    "### What is amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI startups and Amazon available for your use through a unified API. You can choose from a wide range of foundation models to find the model that is best suited for your use case. Amazon Bedrock also offers a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can easily experiment with and evaluate top foundation models for your use cases, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "With Amazon Bedrock's serverless experience, you can get started quickly, privately customize foundation models with your own data, and easily and securely integrate and deploy them into your applications using AWS tools without having to manage any infrastructure.\n",
    "### AWS Development Environment Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create AWS Account and an IAM user.  Follow this guide for more details: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SetUp/latest/UserGuide/setup-overview.html\n",
    "2. Generate some access keys for your IAM user. For more information see here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey\n",
    "3. Install the AWS CLI. Follow this guide for more details: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html\n",
    "4. Configure AWS CLI: Run 'aws configure' with your access keys, set default region to 'us-west-2' for this code. For more information see here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-methods \n",
    "5. Use Boto3 for AWS SDK in Python. Your locally run code should interact with your AWS account. https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html\n",

      "spk_1: Great. I'll need some personal information for the reservation. Can I get your full name, contact details and a credit card for the preauthorizations? \n",
      "spk_0: Certainly. My full name is Alexander Thompson. My contact number is 12345678910. And the credit card is, wait, did you say pre authorization? How much would that be? \n",
      "spk_1: Ah, I should have mentioned that earlier. My apologies. A pre authorization amount of '$1000' will be held on your card which would be released upon checkout. \n",
      "spk_0: '$1000'. That seems a bit excessive. Don't you think \n",
      "spk_1: I understand your concern, Alex. The pre authorization is a standard procedure to cover any incidental expenses you may incur during your stay. However, I assure you its only a hold and not an actual charge. \n",
      "spk_0: Thats still a lot. Are there any additional charges that I should know about? \n",
      "spk_1: Well, there is a 10% service charge and a 7% fantasy tax applied to the room rate. \n",
      "spk_0: Mm. You know what its a special occasion. So lets go ahead. \n",
      "spk_1: Thank you, Alex for understanding. Will ensure that your experience at Crystal Heights is well worth it. \n",
