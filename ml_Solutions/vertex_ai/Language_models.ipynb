Next month, we\\'ll start onboarding individual developers, creators and enterprises so they can try our Generative Language API, initially powered by LaMDA with a range of models to follow. Over time, we intend to create a suite of tools and APIs that will make it easy for others to build more innovative applications with AI. Having the necessary compute power to build reliable and trustworthy AI systems is also crucial to startups, and we are excited to help scale these efforts through our Google Cloud partnerships with Cohere, C3.ai and Anthropic, which was just announced last week. Stay tuned for more developer details soon.\n",

The first time I ever cooked on induction (electric) equipment, the biggest surprise was just how incredibly fast it is. In fact, induction boils water twice as fast as traditional gas equipment and is far more efficient — because unlike a flame, electric heat has nowhere to escape. At Bay View, our training programs help Google chefs appreciate and adjust to the new pace of induction. The speed truly opens up whole new ways of cooking.\n",

    "Provide a summary with about two sentences for the following article: In order to learn skiing, you must first be educated on the proper use of the equipment. This includes learning how to properly fit your boot on your foot, understand the different functions of the ski, and bring gloves, goggles etc. Your instructor starts you with one-footed ski drills. Stepping side-to-side, forward-and-backward, making snow angels while keeping your ski flat to the ground, and gliding with the foot not attached to a ski up for several seconds. Then you can put on both skis and get used to doing them with two skis on at once. Next, before going down the hill, you must first learn how to walk on the flat ground and up small hills through two methods, known as side stepping and herringbone. Now it\\'s time to get skiing! For your first attempted run, you will use the skills you just learned on walking up the hill, to go down a small five foot vertical straight run, in which you will naturally stop on the flat ground. This makes you learn the proper athletic stance to balance and get you used to going down the hill in a safe, controlled setting. What do you need next? To be able to stop yourself. Here, your coach will teach you how to turn your skis into a wedge, also commonly referred to as a pizza, by rotating legs inward and pushing out on the heels. Once learned, you practice a gliding wedge down a small hill where you gradually come to a stop on the flat ground thanks to your wedge. Finally, you learn the necessary skill of getting up after falling, which is much easier than it looks, but once learned, a piece of cake.\n",

It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world.The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n",
