In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a\\nhabit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me\\nthe victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to\\ndetect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal\\nperson, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\\nbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\\nunknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have\\nfeigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\\nthe horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\\nthe terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\\nmarred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\\ninfinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\\nforget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out\\nunequally at birth.\\n\\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the\\nwet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded\\non. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted\\nthe world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\\nexempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I\\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\\n“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a\\nromantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\\nwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out\\nall right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust\\nfloated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\\ninterest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle\\nWestern city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a\\nclan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of\\nBuccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s\\nbrother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil\\nWar, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father\\ncarries on today.'"
