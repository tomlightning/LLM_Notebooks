Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right upper quadrant, but no palpable masses or organomegaly. Laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in albumin levels and mild elevation in liver enzymes. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the liver, which was confirmed by CT scan. The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and an oncology consultation was sought to determine the nature of the liver mass. The patient's symptoms were managed with pain relievers and anti-nausea medication, and nutritional support was offered to address decreased appetite and weight loss. Psychological support was also provided to address the patient's stress and anxiety. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of further investigations and to address any ongoing symptoms. The patient's overall prognosis will be influenced by the nature of the liver mass and the success of treatment interventions.\n",

Go and buy ten more dogs with it.\"\\n\\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn\\'t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.\\n\\n\"Hold on,\" I said, \"I have to leave you here.\"\\n\\n\"No you don\\'t,\" interposed Tom quickly. \"Myrtle\\'ll be hurt if you don\\'t come up to the apartment. Won\\'t you, Myrtle?\"\\n\\n\"Come on,\" she urged. \"I\\'ll telephone my sister Catherine. She\\'s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d like to, but—\"\\n\\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to have the McKees come up,\" she announced as we rose in the elevator. \"And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.\"\\n\\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door.\\n\\nI have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o\\'clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom\\'s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn\\'t make any sense to me.\\n\\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.\\n\\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.',\n",

To my overwhelming surprise, the living room was deserted.\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s funny,\" I exclaimed.\\n\\n\"What\\'s funny?\"\\n\\nShe turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water, glaring tragically into my eyes.\\n\\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets, he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living room. It wasn\\'t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart, I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\\n\\nFor half a minute, there wasn\\'t a sound. Then from the living room, I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy\\'s voice on a clear, artificial note: \"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.\"\\n\\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.\\n\\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position, his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve met before,\" muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily, the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry about the clock,\" he said.\\n\\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn\\'t muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an old clock,\" I told them idiotically.\\n\\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\\n\\n\"Five years next November.\"\\n\\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby\\'s answer set us all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.\\n\\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes, a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn\\'t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be back.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to speak to you about something before you go.\"\\n\\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered: \"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to side, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re just embarrassed, that\\'s all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy\\'s embarrassed too.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\\n\\n\"Just as much as you are.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk so loud.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only that, but you\\'re rude. Daisy\\'s sitting in there all alone.\"\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need any further information or context.\\n\\nWe have refined the summary based on the new context provided:\\n\\nWe went in and found the living room empty.

His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago. \"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently. \"You know the advertisement of the man—\" \"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I\\'m perfectly willing to go to town.

A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly. \"Have you got your stables here?\" asked Gatsby with an effort. \"About a quarter of a mile down the road.\" \"Oh.\" A pause. \"I don\\'t see the idea of going to town,\" broke out Tom savagely. \"Women get these notions in their heads—\" \"Shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window. \"I\\'ll get some whisky,\" answered Tom.

As we\\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I\\nlooked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\\nmarvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months\\nbefore.\\n\\nI’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the\\nfuneral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and\\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\\nfrom Gatsby’s grave.\\n\\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already\\ntoo far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that\\nDaisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\\n“Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed\\nman said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.\\n\\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke\\nto me by the gate.',\n",
