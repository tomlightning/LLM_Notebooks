Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is the most common rash in patients with SAPHO syndrome. Patient concerns: A 24-year-old Chinese woman with no relevant medical or familial history had a 1-year history of cutaneous lesions with PPP and pain in the sternoclavicular joint. Diagnosis: Based on the diagnostic criteria for SAPHO syndrome proposed by Nguyen et al in 2012, we diagnosed SAPHO syndrome with severe PPP as the predominant manifestation.

      "2. **Musculoskeletal Symptoms:**\n",
